# Final_Project_CMSC320
This project will explore the basics of the data science by analyzing data on film production companies. The layout of the project will be the full data cycle in which a data source is located, organized, visualized and finally analyzed. I have a deep appreciation for films and enjoy the craft of film making. I'm interested to see how different film companies compare to one other on various aspects, but the overall objective is to identify different overall production styles. This conversation has a historical perspective as well which is the anecdotal evidence to spur my interest.
